# Mach2

![](./gfx/usage.png)

*Mach2* manages the Windows Feature Store, where Features (and associated on/off state) live. This store lives in the undocumented Windows Notification Facility (WNF), which provides publish-subscribe messaging for kernel components, system services, and user-space applications.

Windows currently contains **thousands** of Feature switches that turn on and off new and unfinished functionality, mitigations, test hooks, and overrides. *Mach2* provides facilities to discover these switches and turn them on or off.

Without going into specifics, *Mach2* commands generally fall into one of two buckets:

### Scanning
*Mach2* operates on Feature IDs for the bulk of its operations. But finding interesting Features to turn on and off can be a chore, so it includes a scanning function. This function scans Microsoft Program Database (PDB) files for Feature symbols and collects them for review. A user can then review the results and cherry pick which Features warrant further investigation.

### Management
*Mach2* can dump the current Feature Control store and resolve known IDs to names for convienence. (It reads simple key:value pairs from `features.txt` on disk.)

With a Feature ID in hand, *Mach2* can *enable* or *disable* a Feature on the local system. Both of these actions create configuration state for the Feature and set the feature to *Enabled* or *Disabled* respectively. The user can also choose to *Revert* back to the default configuration -- that is, let the Feature turn itself on or off as desired. (There is a *Default* configuration state that could be set, the tool currently opts to remove reverted features from the configuration store altogether.)

While the tool can manipulate Feature states, the Feature itself drives state compliance. That is, it can choose to ignore its configured state. Various factors, including what's referred to internally as a *staging* configuration, can dictate whether a Feature respects its configurable state or not. (*Always Disabled* staged Features, for example, are crippled/stripped during Windows build compilation and cannot be turned on with Feature Control.)

## Install
Installation is not required, however *Mach2* utilizes registration-free COM activation to bring in DIA SDK components so `msdia120.dll` must be present.

## Building from source

If you want to have the latest version of *Mach2*, you will need to build it from source code. You only need to have Visual Studio 2017 or newer and Windows 10 SDK.

### Procedure:

1. Open Visual Studio Developer command prompt
2. Run `msbuild mach2.sln /m /p:Configuration=Release`
3. Check the `bin` folder

## Usage
*Mach2* relies on [CLI11](https://github.com/CLIUtils/CLI11) to provide a canonical command line argument-driven interface. It's recommended you run the tool with `--help` for details on how to use the tool.
